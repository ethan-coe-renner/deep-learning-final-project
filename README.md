# Deep Learning Project

## Dependencies
- `pip install deeplake`

## Downloading Dataset
To download the dataset, run `make run` in the root of this repository. On the first run this will create a repository called `dataset` in the root which will contain the wikiart dataset from `hub://activeloop/wiki-art`.
Successive runs will just use that downloaded dataset.
